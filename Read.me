project consists of a Flask web application designed for user authentication with a healthcare-focused chatbot interface. Here’s a detailed overview:

1. Project Structure and Setup
Frontend HTML/CSS: You have login and signup pages styled with HTML and CSS. Each page is designed to handle user input and includes error messages for failed login attempts. The signup page will allow new users to register, while the login page will authenticate users with pre-defined credentials.
Flask Application: The backend is built with Flask, handling routing, session management, and rendering templates. The app routes include login, signup, chatbot, and logout functionality.
we have used API KEY for training the model
2. Login and Signup System
Login: Users enter their email and password on the login page. Flask checks these credentials against pre-set values, logging the user in if they’re correct.
Signup: Users who don’t have an account can use the signup link to create a new account (currently, this seems to be a placeholder without backend functionality).
Session Management: Flask sessions manage login state to restrict chatbot access to authenticated users only.
3. Chatbot Integration
Google Generative AI: The chatbot is powered by Google’s Generative AI (Gemini model) configured with a psychiatrist persona. This model provides empathetic responses, suited for a mental health support tool.
AI Assistant Class: This class handles AI interactions, creating responses based on user input. Each user message and AI response is stored in a full_transcript for maintaining context.
User Interaction: Users interact with the chatbot by sending messages, and the AI provides responses tailored to mental health support. The app can handle specific responses, like a farewell message if the user says "bye."
4. Routing and APIs
Flask Endpoints: Key routes include:
/login and /signup: For user authentication.
/chat: For the chatbot interface, accessible only when the user is logged in.
/get_response: An API endpoint where user messages are processed and responses are generated by the AI.
Logout: This route clears the session to log out the user, redirecting them to the login page.
5. Project Styling and Usability
CSS Design: The login and signup pages feature a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design with color choices that convey a calm and welcoming feel.
Error Handling: Incorrect login attempts display an error message, improving the user experience.
UI Enhancements: Additional links like “Forgot Password” and “Sign up” enhance navigation.
6. Additional Considerations
Secure Key Management: Currently, the API key is hard-coded but should ideally be stored securely (like using environment variables) for production.
Persona Configuration: The AI chatbot is specifically tailored for a mental health support role, offering empathetic responses but without clinical advice.
Summary
This project is an authentication-based web application combined with a mental health chatbot. It blends authentication, responsive UI, and compassionate AI-driven support, aiming to provide a comforting user experience in a secure, structured environment.
